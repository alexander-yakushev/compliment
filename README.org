  Compliment is a fast and smart completion library for Clojure. It can complete
  [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples#vars][vars]], [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples#namespaces][namespaces]], [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples#classes][classes]], [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples#static-members][class members]], [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples#keywords][keywords]], [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples#local-bindings][locals]]. Users and library
  authors can also extend Compliment with custom completion sources.

  Compliment is used as a completion backend in the following editors/IDEs:

  - Emacs --- [[https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_completion/][CIDER]]
  - Vim --- [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace][vim-fireplace]]
  - Visual Studio Code --- [[https://calva.io/][Calva]]
  - @bhauman's [[https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline/][rebel-readline]]

  Besides, I am so glad you came here. You look gorgeous today.

** Rationale

   I wrote Compliment specifically for you because you are amazing and I believe
   you deserve a matching completion lib. Here are the features it boasts:

   - *Speed.* Your time is too precious to wait for completion to happen.
     Compliment is designed to be fast and is carefully benchmarked to make sure
     no sudden performance drops appear.
   - *Smart completion.* Such a smart person like you is entitled to completion
     being smart as well. Default Compliment sources use various techniques to
     give more meaningful completion depending on the context, and allow some
     fuzziness in prefix.
   - *Extensibility.* Your insatiable passion for exploration won't be satisfied
     by a set in stone completion list. For this reason Compliment allows every
     library developer to write custom sources, so later other users of the
     library will have better experience utilizing it.

** Installation

   In most Clojure IDEs that use Compliment, you don't have to install anything
   at all --- it will already be there for you. In case you are a CIDER user
   you'll also need to install [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]] and [[https://github.com/expez/company-quickhelp][company-quickhelp]] for optimal
   results. This [[https://docs.cider.mx/cider/usage/code_completion.html][guide]] will help you configure it.

   To embed Compliment directly into your program add this to the

** Examples

   [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples][Here]] you can find examples of different completion scenarios Compliment
   supports.

   You can advise Compliment to provide special treatment for certain Vars by
   attaching metadata to them. See the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Metadata][Metadata]] page for details.

** For developers

   See the test files to get an idea how public API and completion sources work.

   To understand what is a context and how it works see the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Context][Context]] wiki
   page.

   How to write your own sources is explained on the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Custom-sources][Custom sources]] page.
